# Approach Explanation: Persona-Driven Document Intelligence

## System Architecture

Our Universal Document Intelligence System follows a modular architecture designed for scalability and efficiency:

```
Input Processing → Structure Analysis → Semantic Understanding → Persona Matching → Output Generation
```

**Core Components:**
- `main.py`: Entry point and collection orchestrator
- `src/persona_driven_extractor.py`: Core intelligence engine (DocumentIntelligenceSystem class)
- Multi-layer processing pipeline with fallback mechanisms
- JSON-based input/output for structured data exchange

## Core Methodology

### 1. Document Structure Analysis
The system begins by performing comprehensive structural analysis using PyMuPDF to extract:
- Text blocks with precise positioning and formatting
- Font hierarchy analysis to identify headers, subheaders, and body text
- Page layout understanding including columns, tables, and figures
- Semantic boundaries between different content sections

### 2. Intelligent Section Detection
Rather than relying on predefined templates, our approach uses adaptive algorithms to:
- Identify section boundaries through font size variations and formatting changes
- Detect hierarchical document structure automatically
- Extract meaningful section titles using pattern recognition
- Map content relationships across pages and documents

### 3. Persona-Driven Relevance Scoring
The heart of our system is the persona-aware relevance engine that:
- Analyzes the persona description and job-to-be-done to extract key domain concepts
- Generates semantic embeddings using lightweight transformer models (within 1GB constraint)
- Scores each document section based on alignment with persona requirements
- Prioritizes content based on both semantic relevance and structural importance

### 4. Multi-Document Synthesis
For collections of related documents, the system:
- Identifies overlapping and complementary content across documents
- Eliminates redundancy while preserving unique insights
- Creates cross-document relationships and references
- Ensures comprehensive coverage of the persona's requirements

## Technical Implementation

### Efficiency Optimizations
- CPU-only processing using optimized NumPy operations
- Lightweight sentence transformers for semantic analysis
- Streaming document processing to manage memory usage
- Caching mechanisms for repeated computations

### Accuracy Measures
- Multi-pass validation of extracted sections
- Confidence scoring for each extraction
- Fallback mechanisms for edge cases
- Quality checks against expected output format

The system achieves high accuracy through this layered approach, combining structural understanding with semantic intelligence while maintaining efficiency constraints. The persona-driven focus ensures that extracted content directly serves the user's specific needs rather than providing generic summaries.
